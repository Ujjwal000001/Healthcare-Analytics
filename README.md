# HealthStat: Elective Hip Replacement Analytics

*Optimizing Hospital Efficiency Through Length-of-Stay and Cost Analysis*
A Power BI dashboard analyzing 151 New York hospitals performing elective hip replacement surgeries, focusing on operational efficiency metrics.

# Short Description / Purpose#

This healthcare analytics dashboard helps hospital administrators identify efficiency improvement opportunities by comparing Length of Stay (LOS) and cost metrics across facilities. It enables data-driven decisions to reduce operational costs while maintaining quality of care for elective hip replacement procedures.

#Tech Stack

# Highlights

**Business Problem**
    
    **Hospitals struggle with:**

    High variability in hip replacement costs ($7.7K-$95K)

    Inefficient Length of Stay (LOS) management

    Lack of benchmarking against regional peers

    Unknown drivers of operational inefficiency

**Goal of the Dashboard**

    Benchmark hospital performance against state averages

    Identify key cost/LOS drivers through root cause analysis

    Enable targeted efficiency improvements

    Provide facility-specific performance profiling

**Walkthrough of Key Visuals**

  **LOS Comparison:**

    State-wide KPIs: Avg LOS (2.65 days), Avg Cost ($21K)

    Hospital count (151) and discharge volume analytics

    Regional segmentation (7 health service areas)

  **Cost Comparison:**

    Top/Bottom 3 hospitals by cost efficiency

    Key influencer analysis (e.g., Capital region saves $9.33K)

    Scatter plot: LOS vs. Cost correlation by hospital

  **Hospital Profile:**

    Facility-specific benchmarking (vs. state average)

    Discharge breakdowns:

      Severity of illness (Minor to Extreme)

      Mortality risk distribution

      Patient disposition outcomes

      Diagnosis category analysis

  **Business Impact & Insights**
  
    Cost Reduction: Identify $7.78K-$9.33K savings potential in specific regions

    LOS Optimization: Target 23% reduction opportunities from 2.65-day average

    Resource Allocation: Adjust staffing based on severity/mortality risk patterns

    Quality Improvement: Reduce skilled nursing referrals (high-LOS driver)
